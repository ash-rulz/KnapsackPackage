## General Overview
The KnapsackPackage has 3 different solutions to solve the knapsack problem. 
The knapsack problem is the problem to find the list of elements that can fit a
knapsack of a given weight.
The KnapsackPackage has 3 different solutions:

1. Brute force search: The brute force algorithm sorts through all possible 
combinations of items and selects those items whose weights are less than 
knapsack weight and simultaneously have the greatest value.
2. Dynamic Programming: There are 2 steps in dynamic programming: first step is 
to find the matrix using the formula
$v[i,j] = max{v[i-1, w], v[i-1,w-w[i]]+p[i]}$. Using the matrix and sequence of 
decisions, the elements and the sum of values is found.
3. Greedy heuristic: In this algorithm, the highest valuable elements are found 
and they are added to the knapsack first.

All 3 functions take 2 inputs:
x - Containing the input matrix containing the elements
W - Maximum weight of the knapsack
The brute force function takes an extra input to run it in parallel mode.

## Questions:
    ```{r, include = TRUE, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
    suppressWarnings(RNGversion(min(as.character(getRversion()),"3.5.3")))
    set.seed(42, kind = "Mersenne-Twister", normal.kind = "Inversion")
    n <- 2000
    knapsack_objects <- data.frame(
      w=sample(1:4000, size = n, replace = TRUE),
      v=runif(n = n, 0, 10000)
    )
    ```
### Brute force search

How much time does it takes to run the algorithm for n = 16 objects?
    ```{r, include = TRUE, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
    system.time(brute_force_knapsack(x = knapsack_objects[1:16,], W = 3500, parallel = FALSE))
    ```
What performance gain could you get by parallelizing brute force search?
Note: On parallelization, the run-time as compared to non-parallelized brute force is more. When profiled, we found that the "makeCluster" line is taking up most time. Hence the delay while running in parallel mode.

### Dynamic programming

How much time does it takes to run the algorithm for n = 500 objects?
    ```{r, include = TRUE, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
    system.time(knapsack_dynamic(x = knapsack_objects[1:500,], W = 3500))
    ```

### Greedy heuristic

How much time does it takes to run the algorithm for n = 1000000 objects?
    ```{r, include = TRUE, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
    suppressWarnings(RNGversion(min(as.character(getRversion()),"3.5.3")))
    set.seed(42, kind = "Mersenne-Twister", normal.kind = "Inversion")
    n <- 1000000
    knapsack_objects <- data.frame(
      w=sample(1:4000, size = n, replace = TRUE),
      v=runif(n = n, 0, 10000)
    )
    ```
    ```{r, include = TRUE, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
    system.time(greedy_knapsack(x = knapsack_objects[1:1000000,], W = 3500))
    ```

## Profiling
In knapsack_dynamic method, there was a line which calculated temp_var as shown 
below:
    ```{r, include = TRUE, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
    temp_var <- (j-x$w[i-1])	
    ```
This was happening inside the loop and it was trying to refer to x$w for i-1 
index. The new implementation removed this back-reference and the difference in running-time is clearly visible:

```{r, out.width = "800px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ash-rulz/KnapsackPackage/main/vignettes/Dynamic.png")
```
